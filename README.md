# EqTool

Features:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Detect EQ directory location instead of user required to enter it.</li>
<li>Add a notice that Logging needs to be turned on, and a button that can be pressed to enable it.</li>
<li>Detect Spells cast on others (this is a best guess as I am reading the log file so chloroplast and Regrowth of the growth have the same message)</li>
<li>Filter spells show by class</li>
<li>Hide Players buffs completely</li>
<li>Automatically remove From dead npc/player from the spell list.</li>
<li>Add a DPS meter window(In Progress . . . )</li>
<li>Have a Map which uses the 3d assets from the eq directory. This will be very helpful in places like Kedge keep or any dungeon that has overlapping areas. Of course You will be able to zoom, pan around as you would expect in a 3d viewer.(Not implemented yet)</li>
<li>Remember the last settings for window locations/options. I hate opening nparse, only to open map and spells and reposition them because it does not remember my last configuration.(Not implemented yet)</li>
